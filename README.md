This simulation validates Embodiment B (Inductive Direct-Heating in Liquid Hydrocarbons). It demonstrates that the proposed thermodynamic lift mechanism—utilizing a localized Leidenfrost vapor shell—provides sufficient buoyancy and shear stability to grow macroscopic Carbon Nanotube (CNT) yarns exceeding 1.0 meter in length.
